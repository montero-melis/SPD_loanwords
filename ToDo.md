# All of us

- Sigi, Guillermo: check equivalent lists of loanwords Dutch/Spanish.
	- We are looking for prescriptive lists: words that have an equivalent in the receiver language
- Read project proposals: G first two, Sus middle 2, Sigi last 2
- Everybody using the git repository on GitHub to collaborate
- Download JabRef


# Theoretical background

## Meaning (Sus, G)

- Definition of meaning: Wälchli and Cysouw (2012), Sigström (?) LSA [Susanne REF], Linell (?)
- Measuring meaning
	- Corpus linguistics
	- Experimental data: semantic differentials, acceptability judgements

# Loanwords

- Online site: world loanword database `http://wold.livingsources.org/`
- How does the meaning of a word change when it is loaned into a different languages?

# Research questions

Do we need to adapt them to the specifics of the loanwords in each language?

# Hypotheses

We should find something in the literature that leads to certain hypotheses (esp. in section on loanwords)

# Time table (3 years)
