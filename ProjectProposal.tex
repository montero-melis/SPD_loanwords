%% Bibliography:
%This bibliography style does not fit to any particular one (e.g. Harvard, APA), but is still quite good-looking:
\usepackage[style=authoryear-comp,maxnames=2,isbn=false,doi=false,firstinits=true, url=false]{biblatex}
%A slight variation with the options explained in the pdf file for biblatex package; yhe main difference is that 3 authors will be shown instead of directly "et al." if >3:
%\usepackage[style=authoryear-icomp, bibstyle=authoryear, minnames=3, isbn=false, url=false, doi=false]{biblatex}
\bibliography{bib} %Specify whatever the name of your bibliography here!
%Exported entries from Zotero have too many unwanted fields. This is the way to ged rid of them in the bibliography:
\AtEveryBibitem{% Clean up the bibtex rather than editing it
 \clearfield{date}
 \clearfield{eprint}
 \clearfield{isbn}
 \clearfield{issn}
 \clearfield{month}
 \clearfield{series}
 \clearfield{number}
  \clearfield{note}
 
 \ifentrytype{book}{}{% Remove publisher and editor except for books
  \clearlist{publisher}
  \clearname{editor}
 }
}

\usepackage[nodayofweek]{datetime} %A nice style for date, cf. document "datetime-formats" in LaTeX documentation folder; here I use \longdate, see below

\title{The crosslinguistic intertextuality of loanwords}
\author{Vejdemo, Susanne \and Vandewinkel, Sigi \and Montero-Melis, Guillermo}

\longdate % That's the specific style used with the datetime package (see above)
%The problem I've had is that I don't know how to set one specific date and have it written in the \longdate format...

%Some handy shorthands for citing:
\newcommand{\pc}{\parencite}
\newcommand{\tc}{\textcite}

\section{Presentation and aims} 
 
The semantic meaning potential of words is to a large extent governed by their intertextual history of use (ref Linell, ref Traugott \& Dasher).
Loanwords are an interesting case, since they have a history in their source language, but lose some of their meaning potential when they are borrowed.
We wish to examine the following topics:
%
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
	\item \label{list_change} How much of a word's meaning changes when it is borrowed (e.g. the term `body guard', borrowed from English into Swedish), i.e how much of its meaning potential and history is lost?
	\item \label{list_share} After a loan word is established, how does it share the semantic space with already existing, seemingly synonymous native words (e.g. the Swedish term `livvakt', body guard.)
	\item How do \ref{list_change} and \ref{list_share} compare across three European languages, i.e. Swedish, Dutch, and Spanish?
\end{enumerate}
%
By using both quantitative experimental and corpus methods, as well as qualitative interview methods, we also wish to examine if there are marked discrepancies between the measurements of meaning and the subjective reported opinions about meanings of speakers.
