	a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100
	orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated
	by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item
	vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document
	vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents
	with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find
	this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising. {\textcopyright}

	a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity
	of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy
	of {LSA's} reflection of human knowledge has been established in
	a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans
	on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human
	word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word-word and passage-word
	lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in

  publisher = {Routledge},

  author = {Linell, Per},
  abstract = {There is a 'written language bias' in the language sciences, particularly
	in linguistics. Within the discipline of linguistics, models and
	theories of language have been developed that are strongly dependent
	on long-time traditions of dealing with writing and written language.
	This legacy is still alive in modern, mainstream theoretical linguistics.
	As a consequence a paradox arises: there is an almost unanimous agreement
	on the absolute primacy of spoken language, yet language is explored
	from theoretical and methodological points of departure that are
	ultimately derived from concerns with cultivating, standardising
	and teaching forms of written language. The author substantiates
	claims about the 'written language bias' using arguments and points
	from the theory and philosophy of language, phonology, grammer, lexicology,semantics,
	pragmatics, theory of text and discourse. Special attention is given
	to the notion of the single, unitary language, the distinction between
	language and speech, the view onlanguage as a set of abstract objects
	and rules, the sentences as the fundamental unit of language, among
	other themes. Although the book focuses on mainstream linguistics,
	it also sketches an alternative theory of language which describes
	language use and talk-in-interaction in dialogical terms and as embodied,

	by saying {\textquotedblleft}the men are taller than the women{\textquotedblright}?
	We explore comparison of pluralities in two experiments, eliciting
	comparison judgments while varying the properties of the members
	of each set. We find that a plurality is judged as {\textquotedblleft}bigger{\textquotedblright}
	when the mean size of its members is larger than the mean size of
	the competing plurality. These results are incompatible with previous
	accounts, in which plural comparison is inferred from many instances
	of singular comparison between the members of the sets {(Matushansky}
	\&amp; Ruys, 2006). Our results suggest the need for a type of predication
	that ascribes properties to plural entities, not just individuals,
	based on aggregate statistics of their members. More generally, these
	results support the idea that sets and their properties are actively
	represented as single units.},
