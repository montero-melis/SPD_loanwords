	abstract = {Latent Semantic Analysis {(LSA)} is a theory and method for extracting and representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text {(Landauer} \& Dumais, 1997). The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of {LSA's} reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates word-word and passage-word lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the functions played by English loanwords in Japanese. It is shown that English loanwords have a role that extends far beyond the simple filling of lexical-gaps. Indeed, loanwords frequently take the place of an existing native equivalent where they perform a variety of "special effect" functions. In addition, English loanwords may be employed for euphemistic effect when a native equivalent is considered too direct. Drawing largely on examples of loanword use from advertising, this study considers the role English loanwords play as lexical gap fillers, special effect givers, and euphemisms.},

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents ({\textquotedblleft}semantic structure{\textquotedblright}) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising. {\textcopyright} 1990 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {There is a 'written language bias' in the language sciences, particularly in linguistics. Within the discipline of linguistics, models and theories of language have been developed that are strongly dependent on long-time traditions of dealing with writing and written language. This legacy is still alive in modern, mainstream theoretical linguistics. As a consequence a paradox arises: there is an almost unanimous agreement on the absolute primacy of spoken language, yet language is explored from theoretical and methodological points of departure that are ultimately derived from concerns with cultivating, standardising and teaching forms of written language. The author substantiates claims about the 'written language bias' using arguments and points from the theory and philosophy of language, phonology, grammer, lexicology,semantics, pragmatics, theory of text and discourse. Special attention is given to the notion of the single, unitary language, the distinction between language and speech, the view onlanguage as a set of abstract objects and rules, the sentences as the fundamental unit of language, among other themes. Although the book focuses on mainstream linguistics, it also sketches an alternative theory of language which describes language use and talk-in-interaction in dialogical terms and as embodied, social action distributed in time.},
