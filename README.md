# Readme

This is a repository of Susanne V, Sigi V, and Guillermo MM's final project for the course in Semantics, Pragmatics and discourse.
The main file is `ProjectProposal.tex` which contains the actual proposal.
Other files containing data in text/csv format, or figures, might be included as well.
To translate a data set into tabular data for LaTeX we can use R, which contains some useful wrappers (checkout `xtable` package).
