# Readme

This is a repository for Susanne V, Sigi V, and Guillermo MM's final project for the course in Semantics, Pragmatics and discourse.
The main file is `ProjectProposal.tex` which contains the actual proposal.
Other files containing data in text/csv format, or figures, might be included as well.
To translate a data set into tabular data for LaTeX we can use R, which contains some useful wrappers (checkout `xtable` package).

# LaTeX matters

- Quotation marks in LaTex: 
	- double quot marks = \`\`bla'' 
	- single quot marks =  \`bla'
	- see *quote marks* in `http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Text_Formatting#Quote-marks`
- To reference a section, figure, or even an item in a list, use the `\label{}` command, then reference it with the `\ref{}` command
